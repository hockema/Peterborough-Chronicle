                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>The island of Britain is eight hundred miles long
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span> and two hundred wide. And here on this 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>island are five languages: English and Brit-
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>ish and Welsh and Scottish and Pictish and 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>Latin [the 'book-language']. The earliest inhabitants of this 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>land were Britons, who came from western Gaul and settled 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>at first in the south of Britain. Then it happened that the Pic-
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>ts came from the south of Scandinavia with a few ['not many'] 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>long ships, and came at first up into northern Ireland 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>and there beseeched the Scots that they might dwell there. But 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>they would not let them, for the Scots said, 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>"We can, however, give you advice. We know 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>another island to the east of here where you can live if 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>you wish. And if anyone should resist you, we will help you so that 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>you can conquer it." Then the Picts went and conquered 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>this land to  the north; and the Britons 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>had it to the south, as we already said. And then the Picts as-
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>ked for women from the Scots for themselves, understanding that the Scots
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>always chose their royal line on the female side, so that they might 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>keep the land for a long time afterward. And it happened in the run of the years 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>that a certain sect of the Scots departed from Ireland into Britain 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>and conquered some of that land. And their chief was called 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>Reoda, for whom they are named Dal Riata [Reoda's portion]. Six-
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>ty winters before the Christ was born, Gaius Julius 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>the Roman Emperor sought Britain with eighty ships, 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>where he was at first overwhelmed with fierce resistance 
                        <span class="lb" data-tagName="lb" data-type="empty"></span>and misled a large portion of his army. And then he
